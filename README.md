# About Me

* My name is Ken Dinh Vu (Pronouns: he/him) and I am a rcent M.S. Statistics graduate from California State University - East Bay (CSUEB). :man_student: 
* My interest in statistics came about when I was introduced to a statistician and recent CSUEB graduate while I was working as a research assistant at a community college district office.  That statistician and I collaborated on a survey research project where we both got to implement some data collection strategies as well as some elements of Natural Language Processing, which inspired me to pursue a Master's in Statistics program to further study these statistical tools and research strategies I was exposed to back then. :mag: üìä
* My goal is to be a research scientist working in the non-profit sector where I could leverage the power of data science and leadership to create change in areas such as environmental justice, economic inequality, and other social issues. :handshake: :earth_americas: 
* PERSONAL GOAL: I'm hoping to do more kickboxing and hiking for 2022 and beyond. :boxing_glove: :punch: ‚õ∞Ô∏è
